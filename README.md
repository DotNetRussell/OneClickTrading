# OneClickTrading
Scripts for different exchanges that allow you to place a trade in one click

NOTE:
These scripts are very fast and have no saftey. Think of it like a loaded gun. If you lose millions, it's not my fault. That said, I use this constantly on GDAX. It's the shit.

Setup:
1. Open target site trading dashboard
2. Right click anywhere and select inspect
3. Click on the console tab
4. Paste in the code 
5. Now you can close the inspector window and one click trading is active. 

NOTE: To disable it simply refresh the page.
